# HEADSETTÐ£
## DISCLAMER
This project is an HTML and CSS implementation of a e-store design, which I developed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bz5D61iQGBFyMOgEjlZP6O/Headsetty?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=t4SpD2LGG0tMcVDe-1).

SCSS preprocessor was used during its development, and the entire project was built using gulp. The project was created in December 2021 - January 2022 to showcase skills in web page designing and further layout.
